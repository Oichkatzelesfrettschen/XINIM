# 0001: Adopt C++23 and Clang 18 Toolchain

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a modern C++ toolchain to support advanced language features and maintain compatibility across components. Prior efforts relied on heterogeneous compiler versions, complicating maintenance and hindering adoption of newer standards.

## Decision
Standardize on the C++23 language standard and utilize the Clang 18 toolchain, including the corresponding LLVM utilities (`lld` and `lldb`), for all build, test, and analysis tasks.

## Consequences
- Enables uniform use of C++23 features across the codebase.
- Simplifies build configuration by targeting a single, well-defined toolchain.
- May require updates to legacy code that depends on deprecated behaviors.
