# Test Coverage Report

The project was instrumented with LLVM's coverage tooling and executed using the `minix_test_strlen_property` target.
The run achieved full coverage for the custom string-length routine while overall coverage across all linked sources
is summarized below:

```
lib/strlen.cpp                        100.00%
TOTAL                                  34.27%
```

These results provide a baseline for future testing enhancements.
