Based on the project logs, I'll provide a single, unified log for August 23rd that reflects the complete state of the repository.

### Project Status

This document tracks repository maintenance and cleanup activities.

Architecture decision records are stored in [adr/](https://www.google.com/search?q=adr/), and dependency lifecycles are documented in [DEPENDENCIES.md](https://www.google.com/search?q=DEPENDENCIES.md).

## 2025-06-23

  * Added `tools/run_qemu.sh` to boot disk images under QEMU.
  * Updated `.gitignore` to exclude:
      * `**/build*/`
      * `build/`
      * `builds/`
      * `*/CMakeFiles/`
  * Ensured no build artifacts are committed by verifying:
      * `find . -name 'build*'` yields no results
      * `find . -name 'CMakeFiles'` yields no results
  * Confirmed all build artefacts are cleanly excluded from the repository.

## 2025-07-30

  * Created `tools/header_sanity_check.sh` with robust quoting for include paths.
  * Added explicit `build*/` pattern to `.gitignore` for clarity.
  * Verified absence of build artefacts and recorded cleanup activities.

## 2025-07-31

  * Performed clang-based build to verify toolchain configuration.
  * No `build*/`, `builds/`, or `*/CMakeFiles/` directories remained after cleanup.
  * Added redundant ignore patterns to `.gitignore` as an extra safeguard.

## 2025-08-06

  * Expanded Doxygen coverage for paging interfaces and miscellaneous file-system routines.
  * Generated API reference with Doxygen and attempted Sphinx build (errors remain in legacy `.rst` files).

## 2025-08-22

  * Documented kernel system services with granular Doxygen comments.
  * Regenerated API reference via Doxygen and verified Sphinx+Breathe integration.
  * Modernized `kernel/xt_wini.cpp` with `enum class` and `std::array` and expanded Doxygen coverage.

## 2025-08-23

  * Established `docs/adr/` with ADR 0001 capturing the adoption of C++23 and Clang 18.
  * Created `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` outlining dependency update and deprecation policies.
  * Linked project status to the new ADR and dependency lifecycle documentation.
  * Generated Sphinx coverage report (`analysis/sphinx_coverage.md`).
  * Missing sources and documents flagged:
      * `commands/cc.cpp`
      * `kernel/wini.cpp`
      * toctree entries for `hypercomplex`, `networking`, `pq_crypto`, `scheduler`, `service`, and `service_manager`
