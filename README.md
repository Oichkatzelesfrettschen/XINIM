# XINIM Project

XINIM is a full C++23 reimplementation of the classic MINIX 1 operating system. The repository combines the kernel, memory management, file system, libraries, commands, and tooling into one cohesive environment. It demonstrates modern systems programming techniques with strong type safety, extensive error handling, and cross-platform support.
