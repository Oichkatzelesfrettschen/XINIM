## Building and Development

### Prerequisites

XINIM requires modern development tools for C++23 and post-quantum cryptography:

  * **Compiler**: Clang 18+ (preferred) or GCC 13+ with full C++23 support.
  * **Build System**: CMake 3.10+ and Make.
  * **Dependencies**: OpenSSL (for system crypto), optional libsodium.
  * **Documentation**: Doxygen + Sphinx with Breathe extension.

**Quick Setup** (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y clang-18 libc++-18-dev libc++abi-18-dev
sudo apt-get install -y cmake ninja-build doxygen python3-sphinx python3-breathe
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev pkg-config
```

For detailed platform-specific instructions, see [`docs/TOOL_INSTALL.md`](https://www.google.com/search?q=docs/TOOL_INSTALL.md).

### Build Process

**CMake (Recommended)**:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-18 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)  # Builds crypto libraries and core components
```

**Cross-compilation** for freestanding x86-64:

```bash
cmake -DCROSS_COMPILE_X86_64=ON -DCROSS_PREFIX=x86_64-elf- ..
```

**Make (Component-specific)**:

```bash
make all        # Build all targets
make clean      # Remove build artifacts
make docs       # Generate documentation
```

### Testing and Validation

Run the comprehensive test suite covering IPC, scheduling, and cryptography:

```bash
# Build and run all tests
cd build && make test

# Run specific test categories
./test_lattice_ipc       # Lattice IPC system tests
./test_scheduler         # DAG scheduling tests
./test_hypercomplex      # Octonion/sedenion mathematics
./test_net_driver        # Network and wormhole tests
./test_wait_graph        # Deadlock detection tests
```

### Architecture Verification

XINIM includes a comprehensive architecture verification demo that proves all documented claims:

```bash
# Run the architecture verification demo

## Advanced Features

XINIM includes modern implementations of classic UNIX utilities with enhanced capabilities:

**Enhanced Sort Utility**: The `sort` command supports multi-file merge mode with the `-m` flag. Each input stream must already be sorted, and at least two sources - regular files or standard input - are required. The utility performs a streaming k-way merge using the same comparison rules as regular sorting; when combined with the `-u` option, duplicate lines encountered across sources are removed during the merge.

**75+ UNIX Commands**: All classic utilities modernized with C++23 for improved safety and performance.

**Advanced Mathematical Computing**: Built-in support for octonion and sedenion algebras for research applications.
