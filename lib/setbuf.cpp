// BUFSIZ is traditionally defined in <stdio.h>.
// Since our Stream class manages its own buffer size internally and doesn't
// currently support user-provided buffers of a specific size like BUFSIZ,
// we primarily interpret setbuf in terms of enabling/disabling buffering.

// setbuf makes the stream pointed to by stream either unbuffered (if buf is NULL)
// or fully buffered (if buf is non-NULL). If non-NULL, the array pointed to by buf
// will be used as a buffer, of size BUFSIZ.
// Our implementation:
// - If buf is NULL, stream becomes unbuffered (BufferMode::none).
// - If buf is non-NULL, stream becomes line-buffered as a best-effort, since we don't
//   use the user's 'buf' directly nor a fixed BUFSIZ for it.
//   A fully buffered mode could also be chosen: BufferMode::full.
//   Line buffering is a safer default for interactive streams if type is unknown.
