# XINIM Utilities Modernization Summary

## Modernized Utilities
- `cat`
- `sync`
- `uniq`
- `update`
- `x`
- Earlier sessions also modernized `ar`, core system tools (`basename` through `passwd`), and `login`.

These tools now employ C++23 features such as RAII, template metaprogramming, and SIMD-aware optimizations.

## Remaining Work
- 27 legacy command utilities still require modernization.
- Subsequent phases will target filesystem, kernel, and memory-manager components.
