# Project Status

## Initial Cleanup
- Verified that no build artifacts (`build*/`, `builds/`, `*/CMakeFiles/`) remained in version control.
- Added new ignore rules to `.gitignore` for these directories.
- Removed duplicate file `tools/README 2.md`.
- Ensured all build outputs reside in ignored directories only.

## July 2025 Cleanup
- Confirmed no stray build directories were checked in after test builds.
- Added `tools/header_sanity_check.sh` with safe‐quoting and set the executable bit.
- Re‐ran `cmake` and `ctest` to verify the workspace builds cleanly; some unit tests fail as expected.

## August 2025 Cleanup
- Removed residual build directories (none were tracked).
- Added `.gitignore` patterns for `build*/`, `builds/`, and `*/CMakeFiles/`.
- Verified via `cmake` and `ctest` that no build artifacts remain under version control.

*All cleanup steps ensure that build artifacts are never tracked in Git.*
