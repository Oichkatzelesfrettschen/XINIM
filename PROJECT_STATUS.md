# Project Status

## Repository Cleanup
- Verified that no build artifacts (`build*/`, `builds/`, `*/CMakeFiles/`) remain in version control.
- Added new ignore rules to `.gitignore` for these directories.
- Removed duplicate file `tools/README 2.md`.

All build outputs should reside in ignored directories only.
